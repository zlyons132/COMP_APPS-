Final code for UF's Computer Applications for Biomedical Engineering class

This repository contains the final version of the code used for the computer applications class for BME students at UF. The code reads in a picture from a kaggle database of sickle cell anemia photos and creates a mask to identify possible sickeled cells. In order to get the best results some values in the findcircles function will have to be adjusted, mainly the radius size and the sensitivity.
